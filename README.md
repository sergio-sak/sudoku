-Program to solve any sudoku

# Personal Goals
--Use C++ to create an actual project instead of Competitive Programming
--Learn new things about C++
--Have fun!

# Project Goals
1. Implement Basic I\O
2. Check if valid
3. Do some research on the algorithm to solve (I'm thinking of backtracking, similar to N-queens. Would probably be very slow though.)
4. Finish the project
5. Potentially add a UI using SFML
