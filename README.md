# Sudoku
- Program to solve any solvable Sudoku

# Personal Goals
- Use C++ to create an actual project instead of Competitive Programming<br>
- Learn new things about C++<br>
- Have fun!<br>

# Project Goals
- [x] Implement Basic I\O
- [x] Check if valid
- [x] Do some research on the algorithm to solve (I'm thinking of backtracking, similar to N-queens. Would probably be very slow though.)
- [ ] Finish the project
- [ ] Potentially add a UI using SFML
